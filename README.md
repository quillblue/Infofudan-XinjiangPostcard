## Infofudan.XinjiangProject
This is another data visualization project for InfoFudan. It's front-end part is based on ECharts, and uses .NET MVC to deal with data.

After some buddies in FDU started the "a postcard" project, they have received many cards from all over the world. The project focus on those postcards, trying to show how much we can do if everybody tried a bit.

Since the project is also taken part in a visualization competition, there is a static version in the folder for running on normal PC.

### Something left to be done
- The management panel should be closed to unauthorized users, and some parts of it have not finished due to limited time
- The project is developed under VS2013, which means the version of SQL file is 706(SQL Server2012), 500 error may be encountered if using SQL 2008R2 or older versions
